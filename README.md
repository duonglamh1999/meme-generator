Demo link: https://duonglamh1999.github.io/meme-generator/

Principles: DOM manipulation, CSS, Javascripts. 

I really enjoy this project, it has always been something I want to do. I learned about about positioning and display in CSS through this practice. 

Roadblock: CSS was a major blockage, adding and deleting meme smoothly was quite challanging

Future improvement: Make this into a React.js app, or let the user download it.
